Golang, known for its simplicity and efficiency in concurrent tasks, is well-suited for systems programming, cloud services, and large-scale distributed applications.
Python, with its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, is the right choice for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and rapid prototyping.

::Python::


-- Intro :

Open-source: It is free and can be used for further enhancements, such as adding useful features or fixing bugs.
Object-Oriented: It is based on objects rather than functions. It has defined attributes and methods.
High-Level: It is more human-friendly than computer-friendly.
General Purpose: It can be used to build any kind of program.

-- Useage :

Python is widely used in data science and others. Some of these include:

Data analysis
Data visualization
Machine learning
Software development
Web development
Task automation/ Scripting
Database Programming
Quick prototyping


-- Drawbacks :


Runtime Error: Python displays more at run time due to its dynamic nature.
Speed: As Python is an interpreted language, its execution time can be slower compared to other languages. This can be an issue if a developer is working on a real-time application or high-level program.
Weak Mobile Computing: Even though there are libraries that exist for the purpose of mobile application development, developers often prefer other languages other than Python.
Underdeveloped Database Access Layers: Python isnâ€™t applied in huge enterprises due to its underdeveloped access layers.
